This readme does not include any commentary about the weather or the findings.  This information is contained within the website itself.  This readme contains information about the development and construction of the website.<br>
This project is present in two repositories.  The data used to build the website is in this repository specified in the directions.<br>
<br><br>
<h3>All files and resource file use to build website:</h3><br>
https://github.com/JeffPinegar/Web-Design-Challenge<br>
This repository contains all the materials that were used to build the website.  Therefore, it contains files and folders that are not part of the final website.  For example, it contains the original starter code, the CSV files.<br>
<br><br>
<h3>The website can be viewed at:</h3><br>

The website repository is stripped of everything except the material needed for the live website.<br>

<h4>Notes about my website</h4><br>
My website differs from the directions.  In my defense, I believe that my site is equally well organized and represents an equivalent or greater amount of learning and skill to implement.  In my opinion, this is because the directions were written in a confusing order.  For example, the direction for navigation was supplied after the descriptions of the pages.  For me, it only made sense to build the navigation first, along with the first page, since it is duplicated on each page.  So I built index.com first, along with the navigation, then added that navigation to the start of the Visualization page. <br><br>
<h4>Visualization Page  </h4><br>
To build the visualization as described, I used nav-tabs for each of the four weather conditions.  In my opinion, this is more user-friendly than needing to go up to the nav-bar as to see what is included in a drop-down.  On my visualization, you can see exactly which weather conditions were considered and available to drill into.<br><br>
<h4>Data Page  </h4><br>
I noticed that the data file contained only a Unix date.  I thought this was less than user-friendly.  Therefore, when I converted the CSV file to HTML I also decoded the Unix date and a clear text date in the form of yyyy-mm-dd.<br>
